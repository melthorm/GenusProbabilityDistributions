find diffeomorphism (mapping) between P_{2n} (the base 2n polygonal fundamental domain of \Sigma_{n} in the hyperbolic plane in \mathbb{R}^{2,1}) and the unit disk D^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^2.
of base 2



P_{2n} is the n gon on the paraboloid in R^3

We want to relate that to unit disk 

Find boudnrarys by locating vertices and 'curves' boounding them

Thenf ind mapping from interior all points to D^2

D^2 boundrary is split into number of vertices equally by n for n-gon

Boundrary maps to boundrary trivially

Interior mappign is based on distance from boundrary

calculate shortest distance to boundrary (orthogonal distance, call it l_1), call the point on boundrary that creates the shortest distance P_1

P_1 maps to boundrary of D^2 trivially
Go along the vector mapping P_1 to origin of unit disk, by a distance based on l_1, calculate l_1 based on distance from P_1 to origin on the paraboloid in R^3 (hyperboloid plane on \mathbb{2, 1}). Call this new distance l_2

Therefore full mapping is

f: maps from boundrary of hyperbolic plane to boundrary of D^2

P_{2n} = f(P_1) - f(P_1) * l_2

Inverse version is just mapping boundrary to boundrary but reversed

use sinc to represent hyperbolic plane



function that takes fundamental domain and patches it 

fundamental group of genus g surface: fundamental group acts on the poincare disk by the deck transformation

deck transformations have a finite number of generators, for genus g there are two g generators

all deck transformations are compositions of two g generators

Find the two g generators, how to represent generators in code as maps on the hyperbolic plane

n gon represents fundamental domain which has particular size
generators depend on shape chosen for fundamental domain

for genus g surface, it's 4g gon
for the 2g generators, for each side, 

pick generator, that generator is associated to one of the sides and the other corresponding one so each generator represents 2 sides



map entirity of center 4g gon to other 4g gons



Talk Title: Tiling the Poincare disk using a 4g gon


100 words
Talk Abstract: The Poincare disk is a representation of the hyperbolic plane as a unit disk. A 4g gon embedded in the Poincare disk regardless of its radius, can define generators that when applied are able to tile or 'reach' every point in the poincare disk. We can achieve this via a mobius transformation.
