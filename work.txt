find diffeomorphism (mapping) between P_{2n} (the base 2n polygonal fundamental domain of \Sigma_{n} in the hyperbolic plane in \mathbb{R}^{2,1}) and the unit disk D^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^2.
of base 2



P_{2n} is the n gon on the paraboloid in R^3

We want to relate that to unit disk 

Find boudnrarys by locating vertices and 'curves' boounding them

Thenf ind mapping from interior all points to D^2

D^2 boundrary is split into number of vertices equally by n for n-gon

Boundrary maps to boundrary trivially

Interior mappign is based on distance from boundrary

calculate shortest distance to boundrary (orthogonal distance, call it l_1), call the point on boundrary that creates the shortest distance P_1

P_1 maps to boundrary of D^2 trivially
Go along the vector mapping P_1 to origin of unit disk, by a distance based on l_1, calculate l_1 based on distance from P_1 to origin on the paraboloid in R^3 (hyperboloid plane on \mathbb{2, 1}). Call this new distance l_2

Therefore full mapping is

f: maps from boundrary of hyperbolic plane to boundrary of D^2

P_{2n} = f(P_1) - f(P_1) * l_2

Inverse version is just mapping boundrary to boundrary but reversed

use sinc to represent hyperbolic plane



function that takes fundamental domain and patches it 

fundamental group of genus g surface: fundamental group acts on the poincare disk by the deck transformation

deck transformations have a finite number of generators, for genus g there are two g generators

all deck transformations are compositions of two g generators

Find the two g generators, how to represent generators in code as maps on the hyperbolic plane

n gon represents fundamental domain which has particular size
generators depend on shape chosen for fundamental domain

for genus g surface, it's 4g gon
for the 2g generators, for each side, 

pick generator, that generator is associated to one of the sides and the other corresponding one so each generator represents 2 sides
