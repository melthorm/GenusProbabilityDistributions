def loss():

        approximate pdf on genus g surface, modeled on disk
        spit out real valued number, kayle divergence between 
        the push forward of the model we're training and the
        model that we want to approximate.

        input n (how many samples from bas distribution like mixture distribution),
            model1, include parameters for base distribution like alpha sigma,

        small function to evaluate pdf
        when making kayle divergence use pdf
